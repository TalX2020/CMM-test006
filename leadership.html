            <h1>Leadership</h1>
            <p>The establishment of many adaptation partnerships is driven by visionary leadership; leadership which is innovative, imaginative, and inspires and empowers others. Over time, many different forms of leadership are required. By developing this capability, you can help to sustain and increase impact over the long term.</p>
            <p>Key aspects include:</p>

            <ul class="fw-bold">
                <li>Vision</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The challenge of adapting to climate change needs to be well understood by partners who must have the vision, drive and determination needed to lead change. The partnership needs visionary leadership and a clear and ambitious vision and purpose to motivate and inspire involvement and action.</p>

            <ul class="fw-bold">
                <li>Empowerment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Authentic and heartfelt leadership is needed to empower and motivate inclusive action. Adaptation should be developed with people and nature, rather than done to them and must take account of wider challenges, opportunities, and priorities.</p>

            <ul class="fw-bold">
                <li>Influence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The partnership will need to take a strategic approach to developing influence. Techniques such as stakeholder analysis and power mapping can help to scope targeted engagement and influencing. Identifying windows of opportunity and levers of change helps to focus effort to influence change, including through policy and legal drivers. </p>

                                <p>The visioning process should be open, transparent, creative and inclusive. It is an opportunity to bring together diverse stakeholders, build relationships and identify areas of consensus and potential conflict. Creating a shared vision can help open up conversations about how the changes set out in the vision can be achieved, build social and political support for change and lay the foundation for positive actions in the future. This action is connected to the partnership capability as it helps develop relationships and builds trust between stakeholders through exploring and communicating shared challenges and hopes for the future.</p>

Established initiatives such as community planning partnerships in Scotland and Northern Ireland, the partnership council in Wales, the Voluntary and Community Sector Emergencies Partnership in England or the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in Ireland and Northern Ireland are key opportunities to engage with leaders representing a variety of sectors all connected to the same place. You can use the vision (Action 1A) to communicate the benefits of working towards a climate ready future, motivating and inspiring partners to find out more. Identify whether there is interest among partners in building a business case for a new adaptation partnership or broadening the remit of an existing partnership to address adaptation.
