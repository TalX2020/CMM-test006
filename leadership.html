            <h1>Leadership</h1>
            <p>Visionary leadership, that is, innovative and imaginative leadership that inspires and empowers others,
                is the driving force behind establishing many adaptation partnerships. Over time, many different forms
                of leadership are required. By developing this capability, you can enable sustained and increased impact
                over the long term.</p>
            <p>Key aspects include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Vision</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The challenge of adapting to climate change needs to be well understood by partners who must have the
                vision, drive and determination needed to lead change. The partnership needs visionary leadership and a
                clear and ambitious vision and purpose to motivate and inspire involvement and action.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Empowerment</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Authentic and heartfelt leadership is needed to empower and motivate inclusive action. Adaptation should
                be
                developed with people and nature, rather than done to them, and must take account of wider challenges,
                opportunities, and priorities.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Influence</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The partnership will need to take a strategic approach to developing influence. Techniques such as
                stakeholder analysis and power mapping can help to scope targeted engagement and influencing.
                Identifying
                windows of opportunity and levers of change helps to focus effort to influence change, including through
                policy and legal drivers.

                    <b>Stage 1 - Description</b>
                    <p>Climate adaptation initiatives are often initially driven by visionary leadership from
                        individuals or organisations interested in climate adaptation. They , fill gaps in skills
                        and knowledge, connect with decision-makers and secure resources for adaptation, inspiring
                        and energising others along the way and working to turn ideas into reality.</p>
                    <p>Partners often use ad hoc opportunities to influence policy to secure the support and
                        resources needed to develop place-based climate adaptation actions. This is often in
                        response to a recent extreme weather event, a perceived climate risk facing the place, or
                        where an opportunity (environmental/economic/social) for positive change exists. To achieve
                        these goals, existing national or regional policies, strategies and tools are used.</p>
                    <p>Co-creation is acknowledged as important and built upon, with leadership actively engaging
                        and empowering stakeholders to build a shared sense of direction towards achieving a
                        positive vision for the future.</p>

                                <p>Creating a shared vision can help partners to explore the change that they want to

                                <p>The visioning process should be open, transparent, creative and inclusive. It is an
                                    opportunity to bring together diverse stakeholders, build relationships and identify
                                    areas of consensus and potential conflict. Opening up conversations about how the
                                    changes set out in the vision can be achieved will build social and political
                                    support for change and lay the foundation for positive actions in the future.</p>
                                <p>This action is connected to the partnership capability as it helps develop
                                    relationships and builds trust between stakeholders through exploring and
                                    communicating shared challenges and hopes for the future.</p>
